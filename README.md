# Health-Management-System
A simple and user-friendly health management system coded in Python, perfect for beginners. It allows users to input, store and retrieve personal health data such as weight, exercise habits, and diet, helping them to track their progress and achieve their wellness goals.

This repository contains two versions of the Health Management System, a tool for tracking health and fitness data.

#Overview

#Features
User profile creation and management
Daily food intake and exercise tracking
Calculation and display of calories consumed and burned

#Getting Started
To use the Health Management System, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python here.

Once you have Python installed, you can download and run either the normal_code.py or easy_code.py file from this repository.

#Normal Code Version
The first (.py) file contains the standard version of the Health Management System, with somewhat intermediate/advanced features and methods.

To run the normal code version, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the normal_code.py file. Then, enter the following command:


#Easy Code Version
The easy_code.py file contains an easier-to-understand version of the Health Management System, with simplified code and explanations for beginners.

To run the easy code version, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the easy_code.py file. Then, enter the following command:


#Usage
To use the Health Management System, follow the on-screen instructions to create a new user profile and input your daily food intake and exercise. The system will calculate and display your total calories consumed and burned, as well as your progress over time.
